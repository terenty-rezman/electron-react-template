yet another

# electron react template based on webpack
not the best but simple & minimalist setup featuring:
* __hot reloads thanks to webpack-dev-server__
* __ node api access from electron renderers __(which some of templates out there lack)
* __vscode debug setups for main and renderer processes__ (.vscode > launch.json)

## usage
`npm start` to run in development mode

`npm run pack` to create unpacked build with electron-builder

`npm run dist` to create build with electron-builder
